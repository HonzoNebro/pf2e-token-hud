# FoundryVTT PF2e Interactive Token Tooltip

This module will generate an interactive token tooltip to access all the most used `Character` and `Npc` features.

Starting to work on some bullet points for the future readme:

-   you can hold `ctrl` & `shift` while click most of the action across the tooltip just like you would in the regular actor sheet
-   you can `right click` any skill action (and similar in the extras sidebar) to use a variant skill for the action
-   you can drag anything over any popup of the tooltip and they will all fade out to make it possible to add effects and other items on tokens that are hidden by them (this is also true if you start dragging something from inside the tooltip sidebars or description popup)
-   equipment items are actually draggable so you can give them to another actor the usual way (this module doesn't prevent the system restriction though, for that you would have to use another module \*_cough_\*)
-   the holding keybind can either be used before hovering over a token or during
-   using the holding keybind while hovering over a non-owned token while having the setting set to `Owned Only` will short-circuit the delay regardless
-   you can select the speed to be displayed in the tooltip by opening the speeds tooltip and selecting one (this is a per user choice)
-   you can use the `Owned tokens only` option of `Use Hold Keybind` as a GM (normally it would do nothing special because GMs own all the tokens) to see the small alternative tooltip when you don't hold the `Hold to Display`, at any moment you can hit the key to instead see the full tooltip
